## Commented Solution
1. We need to go through all the characters in the first string and see if it is in the second string and if it is repeated or not.
   There are two conditions so we create two functions.
   One to look for a character from the second string in the first.
   The second one checks if the character is repeated or not.
   Then we use them in the program by going through the first string and writing or not the character depending on these two conditions.

2. Loop to run the first string while we don't find the end of it.
3. If the character is into the second string and is not repeated in the first string, then write it iterate the position.
4. When you get out of the loop, \n.

# Commented Solution

1. Corner case : if the arguments are less than 2 the program exit.
2. We run the string till we reach the end of it '\0'.
3. As lowerCamelCase has to begin with lower character, the first thing we do, is to check it.
   if it is between A and Z (uppercase) and the position is 0, we convert it in lowercase.
4. The rest we check if it is between A & Z (uppercase ), first write the _ and convert the character to lowercase.
5. write the charcater and iter the position.
6. Finish with line break \n.

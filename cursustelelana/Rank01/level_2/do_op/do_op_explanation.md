# Commented Solution

1. if we received the 4 arguments that we need to pose the exercise we start the aproach, if not, we write a line break and exit.
2. We need to convert the number's array in an signed int, so we should use atoi function for argv [1] and argv [3].
3. if argv 2[0] in position 0 is some of the aritmetic operators asked, printf of the result.
4. Finish the programme with line break \n.

# Commented solution

1.We need to create a function using recursivity to write digit to digit. As we don`t know what number and what side is goint to have this number, we need to get the last digit. This one we can do it using module % but before showing on the screen we need to call ourshelves with a figure shorter and get the last digit of this new figure etc.. til the number reduce it to 1 digit.
2. Then we can use a loop that finish when the number reach 100 an theirs conditions ( multiple of 15, 3 and 5 ) otherwise we call the write function and show on the screen the number.

# Commented Solution

1. it is created a function "ft_putchar" that is responsible for painting a character as many times as indicated by a variable of type int 
2. It is created a function "repeat_alpha" that runs through a string and as long as it does not reach '\0' , it checks that the character 
   is a lowercase or uppercase letter and calls putchar to write it and if not, it simply writes the character. 
3. The programa called the function repeat_alpha passing the argument argv[1] and then write a line break.

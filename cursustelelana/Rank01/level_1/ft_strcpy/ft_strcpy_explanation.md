## Commented Solution

1. We declare an index to use it in the loop.
2. We need a loop to trasverse the string. As long as the caracter at the index position is not the end of the string. 
   We will put each of the characters in s2 into s1, when it runs out and the loop finishes, then we put a /'0' as the end 
   of the string and return the result.

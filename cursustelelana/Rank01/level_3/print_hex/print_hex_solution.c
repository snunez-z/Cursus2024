# Commented solution

1.As we are going to receive the number in base 10 and as a string we need a function of convertion from char to number.
2.Now we need to convert the number in base 10 to base hexa (16). 
  for it, create special putnbr using a conversion table of hexa.
  This function would work with any base, so in our programme with must take as a second argument the base (16).
